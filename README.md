# YouTwo
***The next 3DS YouTube Client***

## Roadmap

- [ ] Scan QR codes and save the downloaded file to the 3DS SD Card/System Memory
- [ ] Display a list of videos you can download from YouTube
- [ ] Search functionality to let you download videos from YouTwo
- [ ] Play the video inside the app after it's downloaded

#### Possible added features

1. Torrenting (for faster download speeds)
2. Playing videos *while they download* (*probally* won't happen sadly)

## FAQ

#### What is YouTwo?
*YouTwo is the next generation of video playback on the 3DS. Starting with basic video QR code scanning and downloading, YouTwo will evolve into preserving the usage of the 3DS family of systems.*

#### Who will use YouTwo?
*While a lot of people view the 3DS family as a dead console family without usage, but a lot of people think a bit different. I aim to bring back beloved video streaming to the 3DS. One step at a time, this will, somehow, be a success. I just know it!*

#### Why would I even make this?
*I use my 2DS (in blue!) a lot, and it means a lot to me when people release homebrew apps that let me use my 2DS to the max potential. That's* ***exactly*** *why I want to make this all work out, since it wouldn't just help me, but maybe others!*

#### Doesn't the new family of systems have the normal version of YouTube anyway?
*That is 100% correct, but it's inside a web browser, and also, people still* ***do*** *own the old 2DS/3DS, and that's my target anyway.* *The overall aim is to allow older systems to still play videos.*
